### Steps to move my environment to another machine

#### Install Homebrew

```
> /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Add a new SSH key to Github

Generate the new key:

```
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@domain.com"
```

Start the ssh agent:

```zsh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Then add the following to your `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Add the new SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store the passphrase in the
keychain:

```zsh
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Copy the ssh key to your clipboard and add to github:

```zsh
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```


#### Clone this repo to the *home directory* on the new machine

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:ericrasch/dotfiles-local.git
```

#### Install `zsh`

```zsh
brew install zsh
```

#### Install `oh-my-zsh`

> [open link to repo](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### Clone the thoughtbot dotfiles repo

```zsh
git clone git://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

#### Install `rcm`

> [open link to repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

```zsh
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install rcm
```


#### Run `rcup` to symlink your local dotfiles

```zsh
env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup
```

#### Import the iTerm preferences and color theme

Go to `Preferences > General > Preferences` and check "Load preferences from a
custom folder or URL". Set the folder (or url) where you want to load from.

This should be the exported file here: [Preferences file](https://github.com/ericrasch/dotfiles-local/blob/master/iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist)

For colors, go to `Preferences > Profiles > Colors` and click on the "Color
Presets..." dropdown. Choose import and pick the exported color file here:
[Color theme file](https://github.com/ericrasch/dotfiles-local/blob/master/iterm/duotone-dark-space.itermcolors)

#### Import VS Code settings and install extensions

This assumes VS Code has already been installed on the machine, and in the location `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Code`. If that's not the case, the location will need to be updated in `/vscode/init-vscode.sh`.

This also assumes you've installed the `code` shell command in your environment. If not, type `command` + `shift` + `P` inside VS Code and type `shell`. Click on the option to install the `code` shell command.

Change directories to the `/vscode` directory under this repo and run:
```zsh
./init-vscode.sh
```

This will copy the `settings.json` file to `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Code/User`, and will attempt to install the extensions listed in the `extensions.list` file.
